# **RBAC-Based Policy Engine in Symfony**

## **Project Overview**
This project is a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) Policy Engine** built using the Symfony framework. It provides a robust and flexible way to manage access control in web applications by defining roles, assigning permissions, and enforcing policies dynamically. The engine ensures secure authorization based on predefined rules, enabling organizations to control access to their system effectively.

## **Scope of the Project**
The project focuses on implementing an **RBAC policy engine** that:
- Manages users, roles, and permissions.
- Controls access to resources based on assigned roles.
- Provides an admin panel for managing policies.
- Supports API integration for role and permission management.

## **Key Deliverables**
1. **User Management System**
   - User registration and authentication.
   - Role assignment to users.

2. **Role & Permission Management**
   - CRUD operations for roles and permissions.
   - Assigning permissions to roles dynamically.

3. **Access Control Enforcement**
   - Restricting access based on user roles.
   - Middleware or security voters to check permissions before granting access.

4. **Admin Dashboard** (Optional)
   - Web interface to manage users, roles, and permissions.
   - Role-based UI rendering.

5. **API Endpoints**
   - API to create, update, and fetch users, roles, and permissions.
   - Authentication & authorization through API tokens.

## **Functionalities of the Project**
### **1. Authentication & Authorization**
- Secure user authentication using Symfony Security Component.
- Password hashing and session-based authentication.
- Role-based access control for different sections of the application.

### **2. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
- Users are assigned roles such as **Admin, Editor, Viewer**.
- Roles define access levels to different features or resources.
- Permissions are assigned to roles (e.g., "create_post", "delete_user").

### **3. Access Enforcement**
- Using `is_granted()` and security voters to check permissions.
- Middleware to restrict access to certain routes or actions.
- Custom error handling for unauthorized access attempts.

### **4. Role & Permission Management**
- Create, update, delete roles and permissions from the database.
- Assign multiple permissions to a role dynamically.
- Assign roles to users and update permissions as needed.

### **5. API Endpoints for Role Management**
- RESTful API for external applications to fetch and manage roles & permissions.
- Secure authentication via API tokens.

### **6. Admin Dashboard (Optional Feature)**
- Web-based UI for managing users, roles, and permissions.
- Role-based views to restrict access to certain areas.

## **Technology Stack**
- **Backend:** Symfony (PHP)
- **Database:** MySQL / PostgreSQL (Doctrine ORM)
- **Authentication:** Symfony Security Component
- **Frontend (Optional):** Twig / Vue.js / React (if UI is required)
- **API Development:** Symfony API Platform / JSON responses

## **Next Steps**
- Implement database migrations for users, roles, and permissions.
- Set up authentication and role-based access control.
- Develop API endpoints for managing users and policies.
- Build an optional admin panel for role management.
- Test and deploy the policy engine.
